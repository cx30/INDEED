The biomarker candidates selected by **INDEED** lead to more accurate survival time prediction compared with the biomarker candidates selected by differential expression (DE) analysis and differential network (DN) analysis.

## Introduction
Differential expression (DE) analysis is commonly used to identify biomarker candidates that have significant changes in their expression levels between distinct biological groups. One drawback of DE analysis is that it only considers the changes on single biomolecular level. In differential network (DN) analysis, network is typically built based on the correlation and biomarker candidates are selected by investigating the network topology. However, correlation tends to generate over-complicated networks and the selection of biomarker candidates purely based on network topology ignores the changes on single biomolecule level. Thus, I have created the INDEED package that integrates DE and DN. 


This R package will output a csv. file containing information such as p-values, node degree and activity score for each biomolecule. A higher activity score indicates that the corresponding biomolecule has more neighbors connceted in the differential network and their p-values are more statistically significant. However, the choices for the biomarker candidate selection are highly dependent on the users. 

The **INDEED** package doesn't get loaded automatically, so remember to load it first:

```
library(INDEED)
```
`glasso` function will also be loaded as **INDEED** depends on it to obtain the sparse differential network.


## Using the function `select_sig()` 
To use the function `sig_select()`, users will have these data sets in hand:

- (**x**) A data frame that contains the expression level of individual biomolecule from two biologically disparate groups
- (**class_label**) A binary array with group 1: 0; group 2: 1
- (**id**) An array that includes the corresponding ID for each biomolecule 
- (**p_val**) The path to .csv file containing p-values obtained from DE analysis (optional)

The demo data is presented in the **Demo Data** section below. It will be automatically loaded with the package.


Now, users can implement `select_sig()` to see how it works within sample data sets. One good thing about this package is that it gives users great flexibility. For example, although it is known that correlation tends to generate over-complicated networks, the `select_sig()` will still let users to choose between using correlation or partial correlation to generate networks. Setting `partial = TRUE` will generate the sparse differential network using partial correlation. By setting `partial = FALSE`, users will get network based on correlation. However, If users forgot to specify the `partial` parameter, there will be an error message: `Error in if (partial == TRUE) { : argument is of length zero`. In addtion, once `partial = TRUE` is specified, users will be able to interact with console to select their desired regularization parameter **rho** in order to obtain the sparse differential network. Users will be prompted to choose their own **rho**. If answered [n] (Default), another question will pop up asking the users whether they want to select the **rho** based on the minimum rule [m] or one standard error rule [o] (Default). Also, network generated based on correlation can be either Pearson or Spearman correlation. The default is Pearson correlation. `method = "spearman"` will produce a Spearman correlation matrix. For both correlation and partial correlation, users get to determine the permutation times based on their preferences. 

Remember, a file containing p-values is optional as p-values could be calculated using logistic regression if **p_val** is set to NULL or not specified.

The following example demonstrates how to use `select_sig` function: 



```
select_sig(x = Met_GU, class_label = Met_Group_GU, id = Met_name_GU, partial = TRUE)
```

In this case, the sparse differential network is based on partial correlation and p-value for each biomolecule is calculated for users. Also, **rho** is picked based on one standard error rule and number of permutations is set to 1000.

The table below is part of the output:




```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
x <- read.csv("../inst/INDEED_result.csv", header = FALSE)
names(x) <- NULL
knitr::kable(head(x, 11))
```

There are more examples in the **More Examples** section below.






## Demo Data

- Met_GU (**x**): The data set contains 120 patients as columns and 39 metabolites as rows. Here, 29 rows and 110 columns are omitted.


```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

Met_GU <- get("Met_GU")[1:10, 1:10]   # Displying the fisrt 10*10 data in Met_GU
knitr::kable(Met_GU, caption = "**Met_GU**")
```



- pvalue_M_GU (i.e. **p_val** change in expression level of a single biomolecule between distinct biological group). Here, only the first 10 metabolites are shown.

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
p_val <- read.table("../inst/pvalue_M_GU.csv", sep = ",", header = TRUE)
knitr::kable(head(p_val, 10), caption = "**P-values**")     # display only the first 10 metabolites associated with their p-values
```

- Met_Group_GU (i.e. **class_label**, group 1:0; group 2:1)

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}


Met_Group_GU <- get("Met_Group_GU")[1:10]
knitr::kable(Met_Group_GU)   # Displying the fisrt 10 data in Met_Group_GU
```

An error message: `Error in Data[testIndexes, ] : subscript out of bounds` will occur if this **class_lable** is missing.

- Met_name_GU (i.e. **id**)

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}

Met_name_GU <- get("Met_name_GU")[1:10]
knitr::kable(Met_name_GU)     # Displying the fisrt 10 data in Met_name_GU
```

Also, if the users want the p-values to be calculated for them without providing this data, an error message will occur:
<br /> `Error in colnames(X_df)[1:ncol(X_df) - 1] <- Met_name : replacement has length zero`.





## More Examples
